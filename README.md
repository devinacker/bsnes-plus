# bsnes-plus

bsnes-plus (or bsnes+) is a fork of bsnes (based on bsnes-classic) intended to
introduce some new features and improvements, mostly aimed at debugging.

Optiroc/bsnes-plus fork improves the OS X builds (pulled upstream) and adds an Xcode project for easier emulator debugging on Mac.

## What's new

- "Step over" and "step out" buttons in debugger
- Improved debugger UI with register editing
- Redesigned memory editor and breakpoint editor
- Improved handling of address mirroring for breakpoints (extends to the entire address space, not just RAM)
- Real-time code and data highlighting in memory editor, with fast searching for known code/data locations and unexplored regions
- Cartridge ROM and RAM views in memory editor for mapper-agnostic analysis
- Enhanced VRAM, sprite, and tilemap viewing
- SA-1 disassembly and debugging
- SA-1 bus and BW-RAM viewing and (partial) usage logging
- Super FX disassembly and debugging
- Super FX bus viewing and usage logging

Non-debugging features:

- Satellaview / BS-X support
- SPC file dumping
- SPC output visualizer (keyboards & peak meters)
- IPS and BPS soft patching
- Multiple emulation improvements backported from bsnes/higan (mostly via bsnes-classic)

## Coming soon

- On-the-fly ROM saving and reloading from the memory editor for quick hacking and testing
- More keyboard shortcuts for menus, etc.
- Automatic saving/loading breakpoints between sessions
- Similar addressing improvements for cheats

## Building on Windows

- Get mingw-w64 (http://mingw-w64.yaxm.org/doku.php/download)
- Install Qt 4.8.6 (http://download.qt.io/archive/qt/) and make sure its `bin` directory is in your path
- Run `mingw32-make`

Building with the original MinGW used to be the preferred way to do it, but made building "out of the box" annoying for various reasons (including requiring outdated DirectX headers/libs and problems with some native Windows code) and is no longer supported.

## Building on OS X

- Install a C++ toolchain ([Xcode](https://developer.apple.com) is probably the easiest route)  
- Install Qt 4.8 (get [Brew](http://brew.sh) and run `brew install qt`)  
- Make sure the `qtpath` environment variable points to your Qt installation, ie. add `export qtpath=/usr/local/Cellar/qt/4.8.7_2` to .bash_profile.
- Run `make`from the bsnes directory.

If you're running macOS 10.12 Sierra you will (probably not) be able to install Qt4 using brew. If so, try installing this unofficial branch:

```
brew install cartr/qt4/qt
brew linkapps qt
```

## Building on Linux / other *nix

As there is no ``configure`` step, make sure necessary Qt4/X11 packages are installed. On a Debian/Ubuntu system, it would require a command like:

```
apt-get install libqt4-dev libqt4-dev-bin libxv-dev libsdl1.2-dev libao-dev
libopenal-dev g++
```

Afterwards, run ``make`` and if everything works out correctly you will find the output binary in the ``out/`` directory.

The snesfilter, snesreader, and supergameboy plugins can all be built by running make (or mingw32-make) after you've configured your environment to build bsnes itself.
After building, just copy the .dll, .so, or .dylib files into the same directory as bsnes itself.

This fork of bsnes doesn't include the alternate UI based on byuu's `phoenix` library. The purpose of this fork is primarily to add additional UI functionality and I have no intention of implementing every new feature twice using completely different libraries just to keep both versions of the UI at parity.
